PHP is an open-source scripting language used for developing web pages and can be embedded into HTML. PHP can be compromised by an SQL injection. An SQL Injection is where a sql statement is inserted into an entry field for execution. More often then not, the majority of the big sites prevent against this. PHP and MariaDB work together by having databases that allow features like a sign-in system, profile pages with information submitted by users and automatic features like a live clock and picture slideshows on a website. Three major applications that use PHP are Facebook, Google and Flickr. These applications use the sign-in and profile page features previously mentioned. Robots.txt is a text format of instructions used for web robots that tells them what is and what is not allowed from third-party applications. These instructions can range from signing in to the website through another and not allowing applications to access photos or change the user information. But, some malicious robots can ignore these instructions and take passwords, emails and website cookies.
